# PythonAutomate
this is a python script made to optimise your pc automatically / clear useless data and caches / fix corrupted files

Open the program from your IDLE(python 3.10) after downloading it .
if you face any errors for missfinding the libraries you have to open cmd (windows + R / "type Cmd"  / pip install "nameoflibrary" )
then you run the program and never touch anything (let the program do everything )
some tabs will open for you it will ask you if you want to delete or press anything , you read CAREFULLY before pressing anything .
